# Weekly Challenge 3
## **Software Carpentry**
This is my attempt at creating a website using both html and jekyll. I made a python code that said Hello World and another python code that added the even numbers between 1 and 100. This code uses numpy to create an array of even numbers between 1 and 100 and adds them together. Finally, I picked a theme for jekyll to make a **fun** website.
